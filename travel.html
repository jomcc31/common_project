            <h3>Geographical Location: Western Europe</h3>
            <p>Dublin City is the capital city of the Republic of Ireland and is located in the east of Ireland. Dublin was originally a Viking settlement called Dubh Linn which translates to black pool. Dublin has always been a historically significant city in Irish history, from being the main city from which the British ruled over Ireland for 800 years to then being the setting of the 1916 Easter Rising and Irish War of Independence.</p>
            <p>Today Dublin is a developed city boasting one of the strongest tech sectors in Europe and a booming tourism industry. Dublin is renowned for its sites such as the GPO, Croke Park, O'Connell Street, Temple Bar and Saint James Gate, which is where Guinness is brewed. Dublin is also surrounded by great coastal towns such as Dun Laoghaire, Howth and Skerries.</p>
